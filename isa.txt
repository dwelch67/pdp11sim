000nnn  Rn      Register                The operand is in Rn
001nnn  (Rn)    Register deferred       Rn contains the address of the operand
010nnn  (Rn)+   Autoincrement           Rn contains the address of the operand, then increment Rn by 1 or 2
011nnn  @(Rn)+  Autoincrement deferred  Rn contains the address of the address, then increment Rn by 2
100nnn  -(Rn)   Autodecrement           Decrement Rn by 1 or 2, then use it as the address
101nnn  @-(Rn)  Autodecrement deferred  Decrement Rn by 2, then use it as the address of the address
110nnn  X(Rn)   Index                   Rn+X is the address of the operand
111nnn  @X(Rn)  Index deferred          Rn+X is the address of the address

When the PC is used as a general register, four of the addressing modes
have these results:

010111  #immed  Immediate               The operand is contained in the instruction
011111  (#addr) Absolute                The absolute address is contained in the instruction
110111  addr    Relative                An extra word in the instruction is added to PC+2 to give the address
111111  (a)     Relative Deferred       An extra word in the instruction is added to PC+2 to give the address of the address
